                The road to the Sunstone lay through the perilous Shadowed Vale, a place where the sun dared not tread. It was here, amidst the gnarled roots and weeping willows, that the rogue Kaelen faced his first trial: a cryptic riddle carved into an obsidian monolith. The air grew cold, and the sound of his own breathing was lost to the oppressive silence of the forest. He could feel eyes watching him from the gloom, but his resolve held true.
